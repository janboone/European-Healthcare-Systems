This is a project comparing European Healthcare systems using Eurostat and OECD data

The html version of the paper can be found [here](https://janboone.github.io/European-Healthcare-Systems/)

The html version of the file describing how to get the data can be found [here](https://janboone.github.io/European-Healthcare-Systems/getting_data.html)

The [python](https://www.python.org/) code can be run with [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) using the `.org` files in this repository.

We use a number of python libraries (loaded in the respective `.org` files). For the Bayesian analysis, we use [pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/).
